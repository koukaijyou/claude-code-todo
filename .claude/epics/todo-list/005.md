# Task 005: Task List with Virtual Scrolling

## Description

Implement a high-performance task list component using react-window for virtual scrolling capabilities. This component will efficiently render large numbers of tasks while maintaining smooth scrolling performance and responsive user experience. The implementation includes performance optimizations specifically designed for handling thousands of todo items without UI lag.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] TaskList component renders using react-window virtual scrolling
- [ ] Smooth scrolling performance with 1000+ tasks
- [ ] Task items properly sized and positioned within virtual list
- [ ] Integration with existing TaskItem component design
- [ ] Scroll position preservation during updates
- [ ] Loading states for async operations
- [ ] Error handling for failed task operations
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for large datasets

## Technical Details

### Virtual Scrolling Implementation

**react-window Configuration**
- VariableSizeList for dynamic task item heights
- Buffer size optimization for smooth scrolling
- Item size estimation function for performance
- Custom scrollbar styling to match design system

**Performance Optimizations**
- React.memo for TaskItem components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- useMemo for expensive calculations (filtered tasks, sorted lists)
- useCallback for event handlers to maintain referential equality
- Debounced scroll events for position tracking

**Memory Management**
- Virtualized rendering of visible items only
- Efficient data structures for task storage
- Cleanup of unused component instances
- Optimized re-render strategies

### Integration Requirements
- Seamless integration with TaskItem component from task 004
- Connection to Zustand store for task data and operations
- Support for real-time updates and task modifications
- Scroll position persistence across state changes

### Technical Specifications
- Minimum viewport: 320px width
- Target performance: 60fps scrolling with 5000+ items
- Memory usage: <50MB for 10,000 tasks
- Initial load time: <100ms for virtual list setup

## Dependencies

**Depends on**: 
- Task 001: Vite/React setup required for react-window integration
- Task 002: Task CRUD operations needed for data flow
- Task 003: Zustand store required for state management
- Task 004: TaskItem component needed for individual task rendering

**Conflicts with**: Task 006 (Priority System) - implementation approaches may interfere with virtual scrolling optimization

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: M (Medium - 2 days)
