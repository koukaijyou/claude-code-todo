# Task 006: Priority System & Visual Indicators

## Description

Implement a comprehensive 3-tier priority system (high/medium/low) with intuitive color-coded visual indicators throughout the todo list application. This feature enhances task management by allowing users to quickly identify and organize tasks based on importance, with clear visual hierarchy that improves productivity and user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Three priority levels implemented: High (Red), Medium (Yellow), Low (Green/Gray)
- [ ] Priority selection in TaskForm component with dropdown/button interface
- [ ] Visual indicators displayed in TaskItem component (colors, icons, badges)
- [ ] Task sorting by priority with High > Medium > Low ordering
- [ ] Priority filtering options to show tasks by priority level
- [ ] Consistent color scheme following shadcn/ui design system
- [ ] Accessibility compliance for color-blind users (patterns/icons + colors)
- [ ] Priority can be edited after task creation

## Technical Details

### Priority System Design

**Priority Levels**
- **High Priority**: Red color scheme (#ef4444), urgent indicator icon
- **Medium Priority**: Yellow color scheme (#eab308), standard indicator
- **Low Priority**: Gray color scheme (#6b7280), minimal visual weight
- **Default**: Medium priority for new tasks

**Visual Implementation**
- Left border color on TaskItem components
- Priority badge/chip with icon and text
- Background color variations for high-priority items
- Icon indicators (exclamation mark for high, dash for medium, dot for low)

**Data Model Extensions**
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; // New field
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Component Modifications

**TaskForm Updates**
- Priority selection dropdown using shadcn/ui Select component
- Default to medium priority
- Visual preview of selected priority

**TaskItem Updates**
- Priority indicator display with appropriate colors
- Hover states that respect priority colors
- Priority-based visual hierarchy

**TaskList Integration**
- Sorting logic to group by priority (high → medium → low)
- Optional filtering by priority level
- Smooth animations for priority changes

### Accessibility Features
- High contrast mode support
- Pattern/texture alternatives to color for accessibility
- Screen reader friendly priority announcements
- Keyboard navigation for priority selection

## Dependencies

**Depends on**: 
- Task 001: shadcn/ui components needed for consistent styling
- Task 002: Task CRUD operations require priority field support
- Task 003: Zustand store needs priority state management
- Task 004: TaskItem and TaskForm components need priority integration

**Conflicts with**: Task 005 (Virtual Scrolling) - priority-based sorting may interfere with virtual list optimization and require different implementation approach

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: M (Medium - 2 days)

## Definition of Done

- [x] Three-tier priority system fully implemented
- [x] Visual indicators working across all components
- [x] Priority sorting and filtering functional
- [x] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- [x] Color-blind friendly design implemented
- [x] Priority editing functionality working
- [x] Integration with existing components completed
- [x] Visual consistency with design system maintained
