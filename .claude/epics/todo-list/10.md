# Task 009: Recurring Tasks & Data Export

## Description

Implement automated recurring task generation system and comprehensive data import/export functionality. This advanced feature enables users to create repeating tasks with flexible schedules and provides data portability through JSON export/import capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Recurring Tasks
- [ ] Recurring task creation with frequency options (daily, weekly, monthly)
- [ ] Custom recurring patterns (every N days/weeks/months)
- [ ] Automatic generation of new instances when tasks are completed
- [ ] Recurring task template management
- [ ] End date options for recurring series
- [ ] Skip/postpone individual recurring instances
- [ ] Visual indicators for recurring vs one-time tasks

### Data Export/Import
- [ ] JSON export of all task data
- [ ] JSON import with data validation
- [ ] CSV export for spreadsheet compatibility
- [ ] Backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Import conflict resolution (duplicate handling)
- [ ] Data migration utilities
- [ ] Export filtering (selected tasks, date ranges)

## Technical Details

### Recurring Task Engine
- `RecurrenceEngine` class for task generation logic
- Cron-like pattern support for complex schedules
- Task template system with parameter substitution
- Background task generation using Web Workers (optional)

### Data Management
- `DataExporter` utility for JSON/CSV generation
- `DataImporter` with validation and sanitization
- Data schema versioning for future compatibility
- Conflict resolution strategies for imports

### Components
- `RecurrenceSetup` component for configuring recurring tasks
- `ExportDialog` component with format options
- `ImportDialog` component with file upload and preview
- `RecurringTaskBadge` for visual identification

### State Management
- Recurring task metadata in state
- Export/import operation status tracking
- Background task generation state
- Data validation error handling

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- [001] Project Setup & Configuration - React foundation required
- [002] Task State Management - Core task structure needed
- [003] Basic Task Operations - Task CRUD operations required
- [007] Date Management & Calendar Integration - Due date system required for recurring logic

**Parallel execution:** No - Requires date management system to be in place for recurring task scheduling.

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** L (Large)
**Duration:** 3 days
**Complexity:** High

### Breakdown:
- Day 1: Recurring task engine and basic recurrence patterns
- Day 2: Data export/import functionality with validation
- Day 3: UI integration, testing, and edge case handling

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] Recurring tasks generate correctly according to schedules
- [ ] Export/import maintains data integrity
- [ ] Complex recurring patterns work reliably
- [ ] Large dataset export/import performance tested
- [ ] Data validation prevents corruption
- [ ] Recurring task conflicts handled gracefully
- [ ] Unit tests for recurrence engine logic
- [ ] Integration tests for data export/import
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for large recurring task sets
- [ ] User documentation for recurring tasks and data management
- [ ] Error handling for failed imports/exports
- [ ] Accessibility compliance for recurring task controls
