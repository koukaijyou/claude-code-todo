# Task 008: Search & Filter System

## Description

Implement a comprehensive search and filtering system enabling users to quickly find and organize tasks based on text content, priority levels, completion status, and other criteria. This system provides powerful task discovery and organization capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Full-text search input with real-time filtering
- [ ] Search across task titles and descriptions
- [ ] Priority-based filtering (High, Medium, Low, All)
- [ ] Status-based filtering (Complete, Incomplete, All)
- [ ] Combined filter functionality (search + priority + status)
- [ ] Clear all filters button
- [ ] Search result highlighting
- [ ] Filter persistence in session storage
- [ ] Empty state messaging for no results
- [ ] Search performance optimization for large task lists

## Technical Details

### Components
- `SearchBar` component with debounced input
- `FilterPanel` component with filter controls
- `FilterChips` component showing active filters
- `SearchResults` component with result highlighting

### Search Logic
- Text matching with case-insensitive search
- Fuzzy search capabilities for improved matching
- Multiple criteria filtering with AND logic
- Real-time filtering with debounced input (300ms)

### State Management
- Search term state management
- Active filters state tracking
- Filter persistence in sessionStorage
- Search performance optimization with useMemo

### Features
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+F to focus search)
- Search history dropdown
- Quick filter buttons for common searches
- Export filtered results functionality

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- [001] Project Setup & Configuration - React foundation required
- [002] Task State Management - Task data structure needed
- [003] Basic Task Operations - Task list rendering required
- [004] UI Polish & Responsive Design - Styling framework needed

**Parallel execution:** Yes - Can be developed alongside date management (007) as they operate on different aspects of the task interface.

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** M (Medium)
**Duration:** 2 days
**Complexity:** Medium

### Breakdown:
- Day 1: Search infrastructure and basic text filtering
- Day 2: Advanced filters, UI polish, and performance optimization

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] Search performs well with 1000+ tasks
- [ ] Filters work correctly in combination
- [ ] Search results properly highlighted
- [ ] Filter state persists during session
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts functional
- [ ] Mobile-optimized search interface
- [ ] Unit tests for search and filter logic
- [ ] Integration tests for combined filtering
- [ ] Accessibility compliance for search controls
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] User documentation for search features updated
