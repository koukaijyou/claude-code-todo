# Task: Testing, Accessibility & Production Deployment

## Description
Final phase to ensure production readiness through comprehensive testing, accessibility compliance, performance optimization, and deployment setup. This task includes writing test suites, implementing WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, optimizing performance, and deploying to production with CI/CD pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test coverage ≥85% for all utilities and hooks
- [ ] Component tests cover all user interactions
- [ ] E2E tests validate critical user flows (add task, complete task, filter)
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified (Lighthouse accessibility score ≥90)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (Lighthouse performance ≥90, bundle <250KB)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validated across 320px-1920px viewports
- [ ] Production deployment with CI/CD pipeline configured
- [ ] Error monitoring and analytics setup
- [ ] Documentation completed (README, deployment guide)

```

### Accessibility Features
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast color scheme support
- Focus management for modals and forms
- Semantic HTML structure
- Alternative text for visual indicators

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting with lazy loading
- Image optimization and WebP format support
- Service worker for static asset caching
- Bundle size analysis and tree shaking
- Memory leak detection and prevention
- Virtual scrolling performance validation

### Deployment Configuration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  test:
    - Unit tests with Vitest
    - Component tests with RTL
    - E2E tests with Playwright
    - Lighthouse CI for performance
  build:
    - TypeScript compilation
    - Bundle optimization
    - Asset compression
  deploy:
    - Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
    - Set environment variables
    - Configure custom domain
```

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks (001-009) completed
- [ ] Testing frameworks installed (Vitest, RTL, Playwright)
- [ ] CI/CD platform account (GitHub Actions + Vercel/Netlify)
- [ ] Domain name configured (if using custom domain)
- [ ] Analytics service setup (Vercel Analytics or similar)

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: XL
- **Hours**: 24-32 hours (4-5 days)
- **Parallel**: false (requires all other tasks complete)
- **Complexity**: High - requires deep testing and optimization knowledge

### Breakdown:
- Testing implementation: 12-16 hours
- Accessibility compliance: 6-8 hours
- Performance optimization: 4-6 hours
- Deployment setup: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done

  - [ ] Error boundaries and monitoring configured

- [ ] **Tests written and passing**
  - [ ] Unit tests: 85%+ coverage
  - [ ] Component tests: All components covered
  - [ ] E2E tests: Critical user flows validated
  - [ ] Performance tests: Lighthouse CI passing

- [ ] **Documentation updated**
  - [ ] README with setup and development instructions
  - [ ] Deployment guide for production
  - [ ] API documentation for hooks and utilities
  - [ ] Accessibility compliance report

- [ ] **Code reviewed**
  - [ ] Self-review using checklist
  - [ ] Automated code quality checks passing
  - [ ] Security review for XSS and data handling

- [ ] **Deployed to production**
  - [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured and tested
  - [ ] Production environment verified
  - [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)
  - [ ] SSL certificate active
  - [ ] Error monitoring active
  - [ ] Analytics tracking confirmed

## Quality Checklist

### Testing Validation
- [ ] All test suites pass in CI environment
- [ ] Test coverage meets 85% threshold
- [ ] E2E tests pass on multiple devices
- [ ] Performance tests validate speed requirements

### Accessibility Validation  
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works without mouse
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
- [ ] Focus indicators visible and logical

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Lighthouse scores meet thresholds (Performance >90, Accessibility >90)
- [ ] Bundle size under 250KB gzipped
- [ ] Time to Interactive under 2.5 seconds
- [ ] First Contentful Paint under 1.5 seconds

### Cross-Platform Validation
- [ ] Chrome (latest 2 versions) - desktop and mobile
- [ ] Safari (latest 2 versions) - desktop and mobile
- [ ] Firefox (latest 2 versions) - desktop and mobile  
- [ ] Edge (latest 2 versions) - desktop and mobile
- [ ] Responsive design tested: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1920px viewports

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Issues**: Implement performance budgets and monitoring
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Use automated testing tools + manual validation
- **Deployment Failures**: Staging environment for pre-production validation
- **Cross-browser Bugs**: Comprehensive testing matrix with fallbacks
