# Task 004: Core UI Components & Layout

## Description

Develop the fundamental UI components that form the backbone of the todo list application. This includes the main application header, responsive layout system, task item components, and task creation form. All components must follow mobile-first responsive design principles and integrate seamlessly with the established shadcn/ui design system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Header component displays app title and navigation elements
- [ ] Layout component provides responsive container with proper spacing
- [ ] TaskItem component renders individual tasks with consistent styling
- [ ] TaskForm component handles task creation with validation
- [ ] All components are mobile-responsive (320px minimum width)
- [ ] Components use shadcn/ui design tokens and styling patterns
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for all component props
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Technical Details

### Component Requirements

**Header Component**
- App title/logo display
- Optional navigation menu for future features
- Responsive behavior for mobile/desktop
- Clean, minimal design aligned with shadcn/ui theme

**Layout Component**
- Container wrapper with max-width constraints
- Proper spacing and padding for different screen sizes
- Flex/Grid layout system for content organization
- Mobile-first responsive breakpoints

**TaskItem Component**
- Task text display with overflow handling
- Status indicator (completed/pending)
- Action buttons (edit, delete) with hover states
- Smooth animations for state changes
- Touch-friendly sizing for mobile devices

**TaskForm Component**
- Input field with placeholder text
- Add button with loading states
- Form validation with error messaging
- Submit on Enter key press
- Clear form after successful submission

### Responsive Design
- Mobile: 320px - 768px (single column)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (optimized spacing)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (maximum content width)

### Integration Points
- Uses Zustand store for state management (from task 003)
- Integrates with shadcn/ui components (from task 001)
- Follows TypeScript patterns established in project setup

## Dependencies

**Depends on**: 
- Task 001: Project setup and shadcn/ui installation required
- Task 003: Zustand store implementation needed for state integration

**Parallel with**: Tasks 005, 006 can be developed simultaneously

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: L (Large - 3 days)

## Definition of Done

- [x] All four core components (Header, Layout, TaskItem, TaskForm) implemented
- [x] Mobile-responsive design verified across different screen sizes
- [x] Components integrate properly with Zustand store
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [x] Accessibility requirements met (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- [x] Components documented with usage examples
- [x] Manual testing completed across multiple devices/browsers
